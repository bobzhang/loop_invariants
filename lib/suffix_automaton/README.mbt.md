# Suffix Automaton (Reference, Extended)

An extended suffix automaton implementation with additional utilities and
queries over substring occurrences.

## What it demonstrates

- SAM construction with state cloning
- Transitions over a fixed alphabet
- Queries built on top of the automaton

## Pseudocode sketch

```mbt nocheck
extend(c)
follow transitions for queries
```

## Notes

- Time complexity: O(n) build
- This package is a reference implementation with invariants
